### Project Euler  
One defiitive place to look for math problems that require you to implement programming solutions is Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/), which offers more than 500 math problems of varying diffiulty.  
Once you create a free account, you can submit your solutions to check whether they are correct.

### Python Documentation  
You may also wish to start exploring Python’s documentation of various features.  
* The Math Module:  
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html  
* Other Numeric and Mathematical Modules:   
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html  
* The Statistics Module:   
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html  

We didn’t discuss how flating point numbers are stored in a computer’s memory or the problems and errors that may arise as a result. You may want to look at the decimal module’s documentation and the discussion on
“Floating Point Arithmetic” in the Python tutorial to learn about this topic:

* The Decimal Module:  
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
* Floating Point Arithmetic:  
  https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/flotingpoint.html

### Books  
If you’re interested in exploring more math and programming topics, check out the following books:  

* __Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python and Making Games with Python and Pygame__ by Al Sweigart  
(both freely available at https://inventwithpython.com/) don’t specifially address solving math problems but apply math for the purpose of writing computer games using Python.

* __Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers__ by Allen B. Downey  
is a freely available book (http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/).  
As the title suggests, it delves deeply into statistics and probability topics beyond the ones discussed in this book.

* __Teach Your Kids to Code__ by Bryson Payne (No Starch Press, 2015)  
is meant for beginners and covers various Python topics.  
You’ll learn turtle graphics, various interesting ways of using the random Python module, and how to create games and animations using Pygame.  

* __Computational Physics with Python__ by Mark Newman (2013)  
focuses on a number of advanced math topics geared toward solving problems in physics.  
However, there are a number of chapters that are relevant to anyone interested in learning more about writing programs for solving numerical and mathematical problems.

## 8.2 Getting Help
If you are stuck on a specifi issue discussed in this book, please contact me via email at doingmathwithpython@gmail.com.
If you want to learn more about any of the functions or classes we have used in our programs, the fist place to look would be the offiial documentation of the relevant projects:

* Python 3 standard library:  
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
* SymPy:  
  http://docs.sympy.org/
* matplotlib:  
  http://matplotlib.org/contents.html
  
If you are stuck with a problem and want help, you can also email the project-specifi mailing lists.  
You can fid links to these on the book’s website.

## 8.3 Conclusion
And fially, we’ve reached the end of the book.  
I hope you’ve learned a lot as you followed along.  
Go out there and solve some more problems using Python!
